	<h1>Hello HTML</h1>
	<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript it forms a <strong>triad</strong> of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.</p>
	<h2>HTML versions timeline</h2>
	<p>November 24, 1995: HTML 2.0 was published as IETF <b>RFC 1866</b></p>
	<p>January 14, 1997: HTML 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation.</p>
	<p>2014 HTML5: On <em>28 October 2014</em>, HTML5 was released as a stable W3C Recommendation, meaning the specification process is complete.</p>
	<h2>Markup</h2>
	<p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references.</p>
	<h2>How many levels of headings are supported?</h2>
	<p>The HTML spec defines <i>6 headings</i>. Browsers recognize 6 headings. If you start using &lt;h7&gt; and so on, then you'll be using an invalid</dfn> element.</p>
	<h2>Should I use tags such as b and i?</h2>
	<p>Try avoid using the b and i tags, so as to keep content and semantic meaning separate from presentational preferences</p>
