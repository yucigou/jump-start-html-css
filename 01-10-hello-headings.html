	<h1>Hello HTML</h1>
	<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.</p>
	<h2>HTML versions timeline</h2>
	<p>November 24, 1995: HTML 2.0 was published as IETF RFC 1866</p>
	<p>January 14, 1997: HTML 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation.</p>
	<p>2014 HTML5: On 28 October 2014, HTML5 was released as a stable W3C Recommendation, meaning the specification process is complete.</p>
	<h2>Markup</h2>
	<p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references.</p>
	<h2>How many levels of headings are supported?</h2>
	<p>The HTML spec defines 6 headings. Browsers recognize 6 headings. If you start using &lt;h7&gt; and so on, then you'll be using an invalid element.</p>
